<p>Passionate engineer interested in a wide range of applications</p>
<body>
  
  Currently, I am a junior at WashU in St. Louis studying computer science and physics. I am interested in front-end dev, software engineering, and love learning about space and the bounds of our universe. I am experienced with both front-end and back-end devlopment, and love applying my skills to a multitude of different problems.
    I am experienced with Java, Matlab, HTML/CSS, SQL, Tableau, C++, and more.

    So far in my academic journey, I have really enjoyed exploring all aspects of design and development, but I also am a creative human outside of that sphere. My involvement with WashU's Strike fashion magazine as a photoshoot director has been such a fun creative outlet, and you can always find me testing and developing new recipes as well!
